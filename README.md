# GoogleDarkTheme (Alpha-Release) *Retired/Abandoned*

### Reason for retirement
This project is now retired. The reason for this is due to googles terrible css practices. Heres a short list of things that Google Engineers do that is abysmal.
* Giberish css class names. Likey obfuscation which sometimes changes which breaks existing overrides because the element no longer uses the previous. These changes also bring nothing new in terms of the look of the component.
* Top bar that includes search input, logo and account are not the same component across different pages. Overriding it on one page wont do so on the other pages because they're using entirely different css names.
* Shared css name usage for text that are completely unrelated. i.e titles using same css class as description.
* Setting background to white for elements that already sit on white background. Which breaks this theme every time the css name usage changes and my overrides no longer are applied.
* Multi level white background setting for the same element.

It would be so much easier to use javascript to override programatically. Though i dont see myself providing that solution as it already exists. https://nighteye.app/
